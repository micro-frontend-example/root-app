# root-app

## App Architecture Idea

Since the idea is to have each logical module a separate micro frontend app, here is my intial thought on it:
-- App Root (configurations and routing)
-- Navbar globally accessible
-- Dashboard (home page)
-- List (items list page)
-- Detail (item details page)
